The instructors directions were easy to follow and there was reasonable space in the room. The facility is clean and non intimidating.  The room was blazin (hence ""HotYoga) so I was drenched.  My thigh muscles evened out very well during the session, and I discovered my shoulders are a bit tight. I was able to work on that as well.

I waited a few months to have the insurance approve all the ridiculous procedures they wanted to do, until I gave up.

They advised it's probably best to do two teeth at a time on either side of the mouth, but with me being terrified of ever returning I asked if they could do all four. The dentist said he could but to prepare for a lot of pain. He removed all four teeth without breaking a single one. When he would apply pressure to remove the teeth I felt like I should react to pain, but it never actually hurt. He was done removing all four teeth in less time than I thought it would take to remove one. I was sore for maybe three days with the first day after being the worst.

I've waited over a week to hopefully calm down about my experiences there but I wouldn't even recommend this place to my worst enemy. So I decided to try them because they were in network with my insurance company and so I set an appointment. My first time there my visit was about 15 minutes and the first words out of the first dentist I saw was if I had a boyfriend. I blew it off and let him tell me about the work I needed. I then scheduled an appointment to get it done. I waited an hour before I got in for my appointment which equals time off work that I didn't need to take off. I had more pain after my fillings and had to wait months before I came back because they only had like two options for appointments during the week. I went to another dentist and got an opinion on the work done. The other dentist said it was terrible work and recommended me to go back to the first dentist to get it re-done. I called and told my story three different times and finally got scheduled with a different dentist because that's what the office recommended. I also confirmed that the work would absolutely be done during that appt since I was taking time off of work AGAIN. For this appointment I waited over an hour in the waiting room which is an hour more of work I could have been paid for. As soon as I walked in I told them my story and explained that the dentists colleague completed the work once again. He looked at the filling and said it was some of the worst work he's seen but refused to touch me because he hasn't been getting paid for his colleagues mess ups. He said he was broke and if I wanted to pay he would re-do it for me. He got up and walked away and argued with a woman about doing the work while they EMAILED the main office instead of calling them!! They wrote that he wanted the petty cash that they don't have (I have a copy of this email) and meanwhile I've been laying back with the light in my face for 10-15 minutes now. And the dentist comes over and tells me that I must make the ""big bucks, huh?"" .. If I made big bucks I would have never come back to get work redone!! I demanded a refund and was given the print out of the emails and handed a card with the main office's number to handle myself after laying in a chair listening to them b**** and complain about how they don't make any money. Well no wonder you can't keep patients because not only is the quality TERRIBLE their professionalism is the absolute worst I've ever experienced. I called the main office that day and said they initiated the process for a refund but haven't heard anything back to this day. I urge every new patient to read reviews!!

I have genu varus on my left knee which gives me a bowed leg, I use to have it on my right but that was taken care of. I felt that since I'm starting to have arthritic pain I'd better have a final surgery. I go in June 23rd I was having some type of doubt's because Steen Johnson is not really a knee specialist (that's whom they gave me. He's more of a shoulder surgeon) and I was right because he basically couldn't do anything for me, but recommended me to Dr. yaggobucci, and needed to get an MRI first. So I got my MRI and had to drive all the way to the Phoenix location. I got that, got scheduled to see yaggobucci and and I told myself this is it, I finally get my surgery scheduled... Gee was I wrong again.. Apparently their was another X-ray I needed to get from the phoenix location they never told me about. So yagobucci said in order for him to be sure what operation I need I had to get that. So I had to drive all the way back to phoenix get the Xray he needed which I did (so I thought....) Yagobucci sent me to mayo clinic which is all the way in Scottsdale (i live in peoria) and from their Dr. Chabbra told me that they gave me the incorrect X-Ray (like what the heck? There were instructions on the paper of what to take!!!) And I also needed at CT scan. So I got those both in one day, and had TOCA send the MRI to Mayo. Mayo says chabbra will contact me in a week after he talks with his team on what he wants to do... Its been a week and nothing. I called them just to make sure they had everything needed from me, and then they said they needed the MRI from TOCA, yet they didn't realize they've actually had the MRI for the last week. So another week wasted. I've been trying to get surgery scheduled for a month now because its already late July now and I can't get a surgery scheduled. This is ridiculous. I never had to go to the doctors office back and forth so many times and have no solution. When I was 15 (which was only a few years ago) all it took was one visit and it was a go. These doctors need to understand I don't have a lot of time. I'm a 20 year old college student, majoring in culinary courses and I needed to know now what surgery I need because since this a reconstructive surgery, I can't just go back to my normal life after I wake up. Osteotomies (which is generally needed to cure genu varum) can take anywhere from 4-8 weeks just to walk again, my tuition is due now and I don't want to pay for a class I'm not sure I can take, but I've been played for the last month so I don't know what to do. I can't exactly do culinary arts in crutches btw, I thought I would have been in the operating room by now, so by then I will be back on my feet or at least a week or 2 way from normality...Turning 21 soon I thought this would be the perfect time to get rid of this problem, but TOCA and Mayo clinic took too much time energy and gas from car.

Before he moved offices, his staff appeared helpful and friendly. Once they moved to the new office, for whatever reason, the staff became downright hostile towards my husband. First, there was difficulty getting a prescription renewed due to a change in insurance. My husband physically had to go to the office to bring paperwork because they were unwilling to speak with the pharmacy (when the pharmacy had called, the office manager was rude to her too causing the pharmacy to ask us to intervene). When my husband arrived at the office with the paperwork, he was told to leave it and go, but since it was about the fourth call regarding the same issue, he asked to wait for it to be handled in person before he left. She then accused him of being rude and unruly (although no one else in the office seemed to think so), and proceeded to tell him that he was being FIRED as a patient and was calling the police on him. She proceeded to also tell my husband that he was the second person she had fired in two weeks! My husband waited outside for the police, was told she had told them he was fired so had to leave. Due to his medical obligations, my husband was able to make one final visit and when my husband told him that there was more to the story than the office manager chose to tell, he had no interest in hearing anything negative, and basically defended her actions.

She had it written for me so I trusted she did what had to be done. The second appointment was even worse. I was taken to an exam room that mirrored the ones at an OBGYN. I told the MA that I was only there for a physical and blood work. As she checked the paperwork, she said that she didn't see that information in my chart. When I spoke with the doctor she said I would need to reschedule as the equipment needed for a physical had to be prepared prior to the visit. Sooo. I rescheduled again. Although at this visit I did get a flu shot. The third time I came in, I was able to finally get a physical, but it didn't seem like a thorough one.

Regretted it and won't be going back for child number two. I never consistently saw the same doctor and actually I can't even tell you who delivered my daughter because that was the only one time I saw her so naturally my birth plan wasn't followed. Not to get too graphical since my real name is associated to this on a public website, but the doctor did such a terrible job stitching that the NP I saw at my follow up visit 6 weeks later asked me ""who did this to you? Hugged me and apologized...."" if that gives you any type of idea. Also, while I was in labor the Dr. told me the baby wasn't going to come anytime soon and went HOME to go to bed and the baby came 20 minutes later.... Throughout the pregnancy I sat in the waiting room longer than I actually spent with any one doctor. Every doctor had a different opinion on my weight gain (I was underweight and didn't gain any weight till near the end, and then all of a sudden it was ""too much""), one Dr. in particular was insanely rude about it and when I bring it up to other women that have been to this practice they know exactly who I'm talking about. They guesstimated my baby's weight wrong by 2 pounds and I almost had to have an emergency C-section at 12am on the night I went into labor because my pelvic bones weren't large enough to get the baby through, which I originally requested to schedule one and they told me they don't do that, even though two ladies I work with scheduled one with them for their first pregnancies. So I have a feeling if I would've asked a different doctor the answer would've been different. After the pregnancy they switched my birth control several times, I had to come back in each month after 'trying' it out, and once I found one that worked when I went in to get the refill a different doctor switched it! I didn't realize it until I went to CVS to pick it up, I called and they made me come back in and pay another copay for them to write the correct birth control prescription that they should've done in the first place, are you kidding me?! This is the only doctor's office I've been to that will continually change your script and make you come back in every month to make sure it's working for you before writing you one for a longer time period, Mayo clinic for example I can email my doctor as a follow up on a script and she'll call it in and at Cigna medical centers I can just call a PCP there and get the refill I need.  I'm super disappointed to say the least because who wouldn't want to go to a practice that has been delivering babies in their family for 40 years?",4/7/2014,1,P

The way hospitals work nowadays doesn't mean you can just call your doctor in the middle the night and have a meet you at the hospital anymore...it's likely that you'll deliver with a different doctor then you saw throughout your pregnancy, so it's a good idea to see several of the doctors in the practice who have privileges at the hospital where you will be delivering.

I have seen two different Drs here and one Physicians Assistant. Both Drs are Bunimovic Mrs and Mr. All of whom have listened to me and actually carried on a conversation about treatment options. I can tell you this is not the case everywhere. I also like that I can message back and forth with my Doctor. If there's something I have a concern about I can take a picture send an email and I normally get a response within 24 hours. Also when I have had tests done I have received calls from my Dr. Not his nurse or an office person but my actual Doctor. This is a rarity now a days.  I do have to say sometimes you might have to wait a few weeks for an appt but they do have a waiting list you can go on and they'll call you if a place opens up. If it's something you feel is urgent let them know and they will do everything they can to get you in asap.

She exited and left me in the dirty room. Yuri Bunimovich, MD, PhD had me wait in my gown in the exam room for 45 minutes before he finally saw me. He did a head-to-toe mole exam in a few minutes. I then inquired about some small, flesh-colored growths that I have on my face, neck, and upper chest. He did not look closely at me, so I do not think that he saw what I was talking about. He said that I probably have tinea versicolor, which I looked up and found out is a fungal infection that results in small, discolored patches. My skin looks nothing like photos of tinea versicolor. The nurse immediately sent a prescription to my pharmacy for an anti-fungal shampoo. I did not agree with the diagnosis, but I paid for the prescription and used it for weeks, and my skin growths, which I think are actually skin tags, were--surprise!--NOT cured by the anti-fungal prescription. When I had first checked in for my appointment, I paid $25 on a computer for my ""30-minute"" appointment, but after my appointment when I went to exit the office, the receptionist tried to get me to pay a second time.

When all lab and test results were in, we had a 30  minute follow up appointment where she reviewed every test result with me to ensure I understood, and then laid out her health plan for me which did NOT include a bunch of drugs, but supplements, diet and exercise to get me back on track. WOW! I feel like she actually cares about me as a person. She reordered tests to recheck levels in 6 weeks and we will also have a follow up appointment to discuss those results and revisit the plan.

I had to laugh on the way out because I had been so so nervous and anxious. He seemed to be really humble and down to earth despite his excellent reputation and an honest guy. You can tell he has been around the block and seen it all. I had several consults before choosing Dr. Gass. Be careful because some of these alleged doctors will fleece you by telling you that need a bone graft or a membrane etc.. You'd think they were doing brain surgery, the way they acted. Dr. Gass said it was a routine procedure and made me feel more at ease. The front office, Amanda, was extremely upbeat and helpful.

Meghan provides care with several different disciplines (naturopathy, homeopathy, acupunture, etc) and takes the time to make sure I understand exactly what is happening and why, you can tell that she truely cares about her patients.  All the massage therapists are wonderful and the infared sauna is an amazing detox (although I suggest doing this in the autumn when it's a little cooler outside).

A year later after surgery and pt my husband is at 100% back to normal thank god I had the knowledge to know better than to believe this so called Dr. I did notice that Dr Davis has a lot of patients who have been going to this practice for years. That tells you how effective his therapy sessions are. If you need to continue to see a chiropractor for years then he is obviously not doing you any good.",8/16/2016,1,P

My son is not honest with any physician he visits so he is just prescribed additional meds and sent home. I have fears that he may harm himself or someone else in the family. I wrote a letter to this physician because my son has given instructions to doctors to not let his wife know anything about his visits. She is afraid to speak to any doctors that he sees, because of his explosive temper.  I asked in the letter I wrote to this doctor to please keep the information confidential because my son would explode if he discovered that I had written this letter. I was shocked to learn that the therapist showed my son the letter I had written to him on his first visit and it has completely destroyed my relationship with him. My son also told me the doctor read the letter to him and then shredded it. I am sickened by the act of this therapist. I assumed when you asked a physician to keep the information you give him confidential that he would do so. I hope for this particular therapist's sake, that my son does not do harm to anyone in the family or himself because of this therapist's inappropriate actions.

And then at the end I just was so exasperated I said you are NOT a registered massage therapist, and the massage you gave me was terrible - to which he just said oh OK.

I happened into Pacific Health Centre when my usual spot was closed, and Dr. Murray referred me to Peter.  Before I was even in the treatment room Peter told me my back was not the problem at all - he said my pelvis was so off kilter that it was pulling on my back muscles and that was the cause of the pain.  All he did was watch how I walked down the hall and he nailed it.  I was stunned, because all of my other therapists had been treating my back as if it were a stand-alone unit.  Peter assured me that I would be able to get to and perform at my training camp.  He worked aggressively on getting my  pelvis back in alignment, gave me exercises to do at home and answered my many questions over email and checked in on me on a regular basis.   My back had been holding me back for five months and Peter had it behaving in two months.  It was hard work, for both of us, but he FIXED me!   He is AMAZING!!!",7/2/2013,5,P

I had already been paying a significant amount of money for her services, so I felt that I was stuck with her. When the big day(s) finally arrived, I truly regretted hiring this lazy woman. I ended up in labor for three days and she only came over once for about 10 minutes. I had a horrendous labor that was not progressing, and despite this Margie was not concerned about the well being of my child. On the third day of labor, when she didn't come check my baby's heart rate or check on me, I went to the hospital. I was suffering from exhaustion and dehydration, and my baby was in distress. Margie harassed my family to let her into my house to get her things while I was in the hospital, but couldn't care less about calling me to ask about my health or my daughter's health. She was supposed to provide postnatal care and lactation consulting, but we haven't heard from her. After all was said and done, we paid her $300 an hour to talk about HERSELF!!!",9/18/2014,1,P

If your in pain tell the receptionist it's urgent and he will fit you in today.  I've been to at least 150 DC's in several states from the west coast to the east coast and north and south.  It was a miracle that I found him during a weekend trip he fit me in on a Friday afternoon when I called a few places and found no one that does his same technique was open.  I've returned to Scottsdale just to get adjusted by him.  This doctor will actually take the time to fix everything that is causing you pain.  Tell him everything that hurts and get the full body tune up. He has knowledge that will fix any hot mess your body has gotten into.   Most ""Chiro-Crunchers"" don't come anywhere near to his level of expertise which is motivated by a genuine compassion to help people.  He's on the cutting edge of continuing education and has everything you'd need nutritionally. It is all pharmaceutical grade supplements that far surpass the effectiveness of anything a store would sell. His prices are not jacked up either. He has integrity!  I've referred at least 30 people to him over the past 7 years. I just looked up his address tonight for a lady I was talking to in Phoenix, and hopefully Kim will find her way to his table, where her life will be changed.  When I saw he only had 3 reviews I stopped everything. When you find a gem like Dr. Mac you want to tell the world!  I would give him 10 stars if I could.  Just writing this makes me want to plan a trip, or a 4 hour layover between flights to go get adjusted. Another thing that makes this DC worth the trip is that he will actually fix you so you don't have to keep coming back month after month trying to get out of pain. He knows that muscles will pull you right back out of alignment so he does the extra physical therapy type of warm up work before he gently moves your bones back into position.  So many other DC's are driven by the dollar sign and want to do just enough on each visit to get you feeling better but still keep you dependent on them and ensure you'll have to come back.  Here you get healed and go on with life. Of course just like regular dental check ups twice a year, it's wise to stay well adjusted rather than wait until your back goes out and you can't stand up straight.   If you've looked for chiropractors like I have, you know, the one's who put pressure on you to pay for a six month plan so they drain every penny you have or bill your insurance for every dime of coverage you have.  That won't ever happen to you here.  He did not make me have repeat and unnecessary X-Rays before he would adjust me, nor was there a whopping first time patient charge.  I've paid up to $250 to audition a DC, and they all pale in comparison to Dr. Mac.  He is affordable and you will leave his office feeling better from day one.  My golden rule is ""better in four or schedule no more"".  So why are you still reading this, pick up the phone and get an appointment.  Doc, you endeared yourself in my heart forever when you called to wish me a happy birthday.  There was one particular year when your kind message healed my wounded heart.  I'd come back in this year, just to get back on your birthday call list. You have a heart of gold and I hope to see you again.",12/29/2015,5,P

They gave me trial contacts and I had to make a follow up appointment before I got my prescription.

I had never seen this doctor before in my life. Then he looked at my history and was like ""oh you saw so and so"" but he didn't apologize for yelling at me. Yes, he yelled at me.

The staff are super friendly and are always eager to help, and they have been so kind to fix my glasses at no charge at all. They also have a stack of free glasses cleaning cloths which are so handy!

I was very happy with his work and the work of his staff. Last year, I finally signed up for insurance right before a crown came loose. Unfortunately, Dr. Smilovits did not take this insurance and I regrettably went in search of a new dentist. Long story short, the new dentist did a lot of bad (and unnecessary) work and I was in so much pain I couldn't eat or sleep well. I called Dr. Smilovits for a consultation and he made an appointment for me the very next day. He and his staff were very helpful in answering all of my questions on what had gone wrong. In no time at all I was pain-free and my teeth look great. Though I am paying out of pocket, I honestly feel that his work is worth every penny. I recommend him to everyone as he is honest, straightforward and excellent at what he does.",1/23/2016,5,P
