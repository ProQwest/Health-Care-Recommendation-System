The time he has spent here has been very productive and working with him educational and enjoyable. I hope not to need him again (though this is highly unlikely) but knowing he is there if I do is very nice. By the way, I'm not from El Centro, CA. but Scottsdale, AZ.",0,0,0,review

Well, after 10 seconds they fixed the problem. As the owner of a company that does our best numbers over the holiday season, having my phone out of order for 4.5 hours was horrible. Sharpie Tech fixed the problem in record time, even Verizon was shocked. I highly recommend working with this company and I look forward to working with them more.

Found the perfect piece for the retro look I'm going for. I found some other small decor items. Price was fair and they delivered today.  Shawn did a great job. Keep up the good work! I will definitely be back.,0,0,1,review

From clothing to couches they have it all and great prices too.  They have similar items to their neighbors Modern Manor, but not the ""designer"" prices.  We got a green vintage chair for $98 and just are having the skirt around the bottom removed to show the great legs on it.  We will always check back at Melrose when looking for unique pieces for our home.",2,0,0,review

We live in Oro Valley and it is not too far to travel when we need a specific item.
I called yesterday asking if they has something we need and minutes later I was text numerous pictures.  Because of the excellent staff, I will be going up there today.
One of my number one places to go when I go to Phoenix.
Prices are very fair for these past treasures.",0,0,0,review

The first time I was there was on a Saturday, early afternoon in Spring.  I found it strange that I was the only one in the store for about 20 minutes, until another customer came in.  Melrose is usually a pretty happening place during the Spring before summer temps hit.  I saw a lot of nice 1960s furniture, mostly living room sets and home decor.  Prices were on the high end for, let's face it folks, used furniture. The blonde lady who came out to greet me after I made it to their second room (there are 3 rooms total) was frazzled and preoccupied with eating her lunch. So I went back again last week.  Didn't see the frazzled lady from before but a mid-age hipster guy at the counter who didn't have the time to greet me (sorry I disrupted your cell phone surfing).  Yep.  I was the ONLY person in the store and you obviously ignored me.  

It's just an unwelcoming place.  So much potential, but the attitude there is less than acceptable.  Will spend my $$$ elsewhere.",1,0,0,review

After listing and selling a few of these COOL homes I decided that I should be more familiar with a few MCM furniture shops that I could buy or lease a higher quality furniture. 

After going in a bunch of places I can say that I really love this store and cant wait to use them to stage my newest listing in a few months at 24th and Indian School.

Let me know if you need help finding a cool house with character to put your amazing finds from Modern on Melrose.

Enjoy

First, the service has been excellent and friendly. We're new to the mcm scene and didn't get snubbed at for not being ""in the know"" -- sadly, this was a welcome relief. 

Second, the selection is good. Yeah, it's always a hunt, but at MOM you aren't going to be sifting through, basically, garbage to find your treasures. With most of the weeding done for you, the store is a much nicer visit.",0,0,0,review
cNA3oGTmmeRvt10vrvlJOQ,AziQIgYIAY6uVw1k8sbtTw,2LfIuF3_sX6uwe-IR-P0jQ,5,2014-08-05,Walked into the store and stuck up a conversation with Shawn behind the counter. We talked about some furniture and other ideas I had for the home. I told him I needed a custom made shelf. Shawn asked some questions and then he sketched out a concept. I loved it. He then said Modern on Melrose has a man that does custom metal work. Three days later-it was done and it turned out better than I could have ever imagined.,1,0,0,review
